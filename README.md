# constructor

_Note that we use C++ for only OOP and the emitted `struct` keyword. Beside this, we follow the C naming styles and other things._

## Development

- Compiler needed: `g++` with C++11 support
- Libraries needed: `ncurses`

To compile the binary, run:

```sh
make
```

The binary is at `./constructor`.

To clean up the binary, run:

```sh
make clean
```
