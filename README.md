# Constructor

_Note that we use C++ for only OOP and the emitted `struct` keyword. Beside this, we follow the C naming styles and other things._

## Development

- `make`
- `gcc`
- `ncurses`

To compile the binary, run:

```sh
make
```

The binary is at `./constructor`.

To clean up the binary, run:

```sh
make clean
```
